                                <p>
                                    RSG is an affordable, relatively readily available product that has an immediate impact on your carbon footprint.  A few notes about RSG:
                                    •	RSG is natural gas extracted from the ground with improved emissions intensity, optimal energy content with consideration for its impact on Environment, Social and Governance (ESG)
                                    •	Producers of RSG have undertaken enhanced steps to reduce the carbon footprint of the natural gas molecules they bring out of their wells
                                    •	Producers who qualify receive a sustainability certification from Equitable Origin called the EO100 Standard for Responsible Energy Development
                                    •	Their sites are audited by independent assessors to ensure they are meeting the necessary standards regarding emissions intensity; energy content and the social impact and governance
                                    •	As RSG volumes are delivered, the Certificates associated with the volumes are ‘retired’
                                    •	EnerStream is able to sell RSG to certain clients and retire the appropriate number of Certificates on the client’s behalf
                                    •	The premium for RSG volumes through October 2022 is $0.05 CAD/GJ
                                    •	RSG is gaining momentum as a more economical alternative to reducing GHG footprint compared to other alternatives, which is increasing demand
                                    •	As a result of increasing demand, premiums for terms beyond November 2022 are trading at $0.10 to $0.15 CAD/GJ

                                <p>
                                    RNG is made up of the same molecules as conventional natural gas, flows in the same pipelines, has the same energy content and chemical properties, but comes from different sources.  RNG or biomethane is renewable energy produced from organic matter such as land fills or livestock waste (manure).  Supplies are relatively limited, and the cost is significantly higher than conventional natural gas, in that it costs about 5 to 7 times more for RNG.

                                    Blending hydrogen into natural gas pipelines is a way to reduce the carbon intensity of the natural gas system.  There are several pilot projects underway producing data, which will be analyzed with the purpose of learning what percentage blend of hydrogen is safe and effective going forward.  Many producers and storage companies, including EnerStream’s parent, Rockpoint Energy Storage, are using hydrogen on their compressor stations as opposed to using natural gas as a means of reducing their carbon footprint.
